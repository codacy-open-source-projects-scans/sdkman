## Contributing

We greatly value the feedback and contributions of our users.

We distinguish between Bugs/Issues, New Features and Support Requests. We also try to minimise the noise in our GitHub Issues stream and prefer having a conversation on [SDKMAN Discord](https://discord.gg/y9mVJYVyu4) before creating new issues if you are not entirely sure how to categorize your request. Sign up and join our Help channel.

The [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/sdkman/sdkman-cli/issues/new) provides templates for required information.

**Unfortunately, we might close any GitHub Issues that have not followed the requested template.**

### Pull Requests

Pull Requests are _always_ very welcome but require a valid GitHub Issue as described above. The PR template is to be filled in before submission, ensuring that it is _linked back_ to the GitHub Issue number by replacing `#XXX` with the appropriate issue reference.

Each PR should also be accompanied by a passing test(s) proving its validity (where feasible). The feasibility of the test will emerge in the initial discussions of the issue.
